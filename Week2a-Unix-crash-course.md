## Unix crash course

**Update on GACRC cluster training (3 students)**

**Review GACRC training and onboarding**

**SSH Keygen for teaching cluster** - SSH keys will allow you to bypass the password login and DUO two-factor authentication when you are using any of the GACRC clusters (Sapelo2 or Teaching cluster). You should be able to use the same keypair to login to all nodes and clusters, just reupload the key file to each login.

* Raw data for today's Unix exercises will be posted here on the teaching cluster: `/work/mars8180/instructor_data`

**Download files**
* Download (https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/data/shell-lesson-data.zip)[https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/data/shell-lesson-data.zip] and move the file to your Desktop.
* Unzip/extract the file. Let your instructor know if you need help with this step. You should end up with a new folder called shell-lesson-data on your Desktop.
