## GACRC File Management and Organization

Three main file systems that you will work with on the GACRC:

* `/project/labname/` - your long term storage, accessible only on the Xfer node (storage limit differs based on PI lab allocation, usually at least 1Tb)
* `/work/labname/` - your "permanent" storage where you can store raw data and scripts, accessible on Sapelo 2 and the Xfer node (200Gb storage limit)
* `/scratch/myID/` - your temporary storage where your scripts should put all your output files, because scratch has faster read/write speeds (no storage limit)

For example, our Bik Lab project directory is `/project/hmblab/`, work is `/work/hmblab/` and Holly's personal scratch is `/scratch/hmb33427/`
