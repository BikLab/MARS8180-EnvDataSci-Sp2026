Slide Deck from Today's class: INSERT HERE

## Exercise 1: 

#### Written Reflection
In what ways does metagenomic data differ from amplicon (e.g. 16S/18S rRNA) datasets? What are the advantages/disadvantages of metagenomic datasets? Take 5 minutes to jot down some thoughts here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C-NbV2xH3PkoD4guMbyAwmxROvpl5HWxEq31ggtzVH0/edit?usp=sharing

## Exercise 2: 

#### Written Reflection
What lingering questions do you have about metagenomic data analysis? What aspects are you especially curious about? Take 5 minutes to jot down some thoguths here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/14iadH5t0PIfyhQzzpPTIEV4bsY0PKEGzwFEYo149zEw/edit?usp=sharing
